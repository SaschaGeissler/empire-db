About Empire-DB
===============

Empire-db is a lightweight relational database access library for JAVA dealing with all
aspects of storing, manipulating, retrieving and modelling data in Relational
Database Management Systems (RDBMS). 

As an alternative to traditional Object-Relational-Mapping (ORM) solutions like JDO and JPA, 
it provides an SQL centric, no-compromise approach that uses a Java-Object-Model 
rather than Mapping Files or Annotations.

Apache Empire-db is intended for developers who strive to have full SQL freedom when 
formulating queries and DML-Statements - without ever having to use string literals -
and who also want to be able to control when and how statements are executed.

Apache Empire-db also deals with all aspects of creating, reading, updating and deleting
records such as identity management and concurrency control (aka optimistic locking) 
in a easy to use, DMBS independed way.

Empire-db is DBMS vendor independent and provides handlers for Oracle, Microsoft SQLServer, 
PostgreSQL, MySQL, HsqlDB, Derby, H2 and more.
